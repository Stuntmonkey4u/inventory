# .ansible-lint
# Configuration for ansible-lint

# Profile to use (e.g., min, basic, moderate, safety, strict, production)
# Default is 'moderate' if not set. Some rules are profile-specific.
# profile: moderate

# List of rules to skip entirely.
# Format: rule_id[tag1,tag2] (tags are optional)
skip_list:
  - jinja[invalid]  # Skipping due to false positive with Docker Go template format.
  # The following are more involved fixes or stylistic choices that might be addressed later:
  - command-instead-of-module # Playbook uses systemctl commands directly for simplicity.
  - ignore-errors             # Using ignore_errors for resilience; failed_when could be more specific but more verbose.
  # - yaml[line-length]       # Some lines might remain long for readability of commands/comments.
  # - key-order[task]         # While good practice, not fixing all instances for now.

# Example of how to exclude specific paths:
# exclude_paths:
#   - .cache/
#   - .git/
#   - .venv/

# You can also configure specific rule behaviors if needed, for example:
# rules:
#   line-length:
#     max: 180 # Default is 160
#   no-handler:
#     level: warning # Change error to warning for this rule
#   var-naming:
#     pattern: "^[a-z_][a-z0-9_]*$" # Default snake_case
#     ignore_list: # variables to ignore for this rule
#       - 자동_生成的_host_report_entry # Example, not in current playbook
#       - hostReportEntry # Example
#
# For more configuration options, see:
# https://ansible-lint.readthedocs.io/en/latest/configuring/
#
# This configuration aims to reduce noise from certain stylistic or context-dependent rules
# while still catching more critical issues.
